# WaitLess ðŸ•’ðŸ¤–  
**Smart AI-Powered Customer Queue Management System**  

WaitLess is an AI-inspired customer service assistant that helps manage queues in an orderly and efficient manner.  

It automatically:  
- Skips staff (detected by staff ID).  
- Assigns customers systematically to available desks (first-come, first-served).  
- Announces customers via **voice guidance** (Windows SAPI Speech).  
- Prevents traffic by ensuring sequential flow.

- **First Come, First Served**: Queue system ensures fairness.  
- **Staff Detection**: Staff IDs are skipped automatically.  
- **Voice Announcements**: Customers are guided by voice to their desk.  
- **Cross-Platform Ready**: Voice works on Windows out-of-the-box (SAPI). Mac/Linux fallback available via `say` or `espeak`.
